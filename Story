Story

Once upon a time a clever monkey lived in a tree that bore juicy red and rose apples. He was very happy. One fine daya crocodile swam up 
to that tree and told monkey that he had travelled a long distance and was in search of food as he was very hungry.................
the kind monkey offered him a few rose apples. the crocodile enjoyed them very much and asked the monkey whether
 he could come again for some more fruits. the generous monkey happily agreed.
