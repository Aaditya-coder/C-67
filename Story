Fox and the Crocodile

Once a crocodile wanted her 4 children to be educated. She went to a fox to teach them. The cunning fox gladly received the offer.
So the crocodile left all her children with the fox and went back to the river. The fox liked to eat crocodile's kids. So he ate 
one of them and kept the other three. After some time, thee crocodile came to see her children. Then, the cunning fox showed herthe three kids 
and showed one of them twice. 

The foolish mother crocodile thought that she saw all the four of her children and went back. The cunning fox again ate another one.
After some time, the crocodile came and again the fox showed both of them twice. Thus, one day the fox ate all the 4 kids and refused the crocodile
to give her kids because the kids are now educated. They can move now all by themselves. They do not need their mother or any assistance.
